CREATE DATABASE assignmentOnGoogle;

USE assignmentOnGoogle;

CREATE TABLE hiveOnDataProc (Id int,Score int,OwnerUserId int,OwnerDisplayName String,Body String,Title String) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LOCATION '/pigoutput/';

DESCRIBE hiveOnDataProc;

1 
SELECT  Id,Score,Title FROM hiveOnDataProc ORDER BY Score desc limit 10;

2
SELECT SUM(Score) AS Total_Score, OwnerUserId
     FROm hiveOnDataProc 
     GROUP BY OwnerUserId
     ORDER BY Total_Score DESC
     LIMIT 10;

4980 values of OwnerUserId is NULL that is why it is showing NULL for the first entry. If we run “SELECT SUM(Score) AS Total_Score,OwnerUserId FROm hiveOnDataProc WHERE OwnerUserId IS NULL GROUP BY OwnerUserId;” It will show 32076 is the sum of scores of all the owner user id which are having NULL; Screenshot is provided for the same.

3.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT OwnerUserId) FROM hiveOnDataProc WHERE (Body like '%hadoop%' OR Title like '%hadoop%');
